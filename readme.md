# Repo Rangler: PHP Service (Satis)

This docker service will mimic a satis repository

# Usage

Replace the 'all$12341234.json' with one generated by satis and composer should read it perfect ok

# Notes

I realised that in order to make this run through a database, I just have to mimic the packages.json file and accept 
any request in the /all/ prefixed location and return a result and composer will be happy. 

So this makes things a lot easier when wanting to return a custom list of packages based on an authorised or public user
