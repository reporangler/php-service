# Repo Rangler: PHP Service (Satis)

This docker service will mimic a satis repository, but a lot more powerful and flexible.

# Installation

You should be able to resolve `php.reporangler.develop` locally on your computer. 
Maybe you need to edit `/etc/hosts` file or add to dns?

Run the following commands:
- You can change the network, but change it in all the commands
- You can change the port, but then obviously you need to change the curl command too
```
# Create two variables to make it easier to run
port=80
network=reporangler

# Create the docker network (this might already exist, it's safe to ignore errors if it does)
docker network create ${network}

# Create the containers
docker run --rm --network=${network} --name php_service_phpfpm reporangler/php_service_phpfpm
docker run --rm --network=${network} --name php_service_nginx -p ${port}:80 reporangler/php_service_nginx

# See whether they are running
docker ps

# Query the container to see what it replies
curl -vvv http://php.reporangler.develop:${port}/healthz
```

It should output
```
> GET /healthz HTTP/1.1
> Host: php.reporangler.develop
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*

{"statusCode":200}
```

# Usage

Replace the file '`all$12341234.json`' with one generated by satis and composer should read it without any problems.

Once you've done that, try this:
```
composer show --all your-vendor/*
``` 

It should return this:
```
available:
  your-vendor/the-package-name A library that won't work because it's fake
```

If you want to check with your own satis packages. You can replace this file with your own.
As long as the files are coming from gitlab or github, it should install everything fine.

I've run this against my own packages hosted on github and everything was hunky dory.

# Future Ideas 

Obviously repositories which rely on locally cached, or stored files, won't work. Because this project will not know how to serve them.

# Notes

I realised that in order to make this run through a database, I just have to mimic the packages.json file and accept 
any request in the `/include/` prefixed location and return a result and composer will be happy. 

So this makes things a lot easier when wanting to return a custom list of packages based on an authorised or public user
